Description:
Enjoy your favorite music in a new way! Can You Feel The Rhythm??? combines music with fast paced gameplay
that is sure to increase your appreciation for song that you hear everyday! Can You Feel The Rhythm???
combines different minigames to optimize the player’s experience. The game features aspects of other games,
like Music Flow, Chase the Beat, and Catch the Beat. Chase the Beat contains beats and sliders appearing 
around the screen, and the player must move the mouse and clock them as they appear for points. Music Flow 
follows the classic format of beats falling from the top of the screen, and hitting the corresponding buttons
as the fall. Catch the Beat consist of falling beats as well, except the player must move the onscreen
character left and right to the music in order to catch each beat as the fall. Anyone who regularly plays 
rhythm games such as these should feel right at home, pounding away at their keyboard. Even those just getting
 into rhythm based games can set the difficulty low and rock out to their favorite songs.

Instructions:

Chase the Beat: Move the mouse and press either Z or X to score the notes

Catch the Beat: Move a character back and forth with the arrow keys. The character can speed up by pressing the left shift key

Music Flow: Uses the D, F, J, K and spacebar to trigger the right notes at the right times.

Be prepared to switch between games at any time!

Feature List:

Must Have:
Menus - navigation through the game, in order to make use easier

Osu! - game mode #1 - beats scattered across screen at proper timing, react properly to mouseover and key presses

Catch the Beat - game mode #2 - beats fall, with a character running back and forth to catch these beats

Music Flow - game mode #3 - beats move similar to Guitar Hero, and the player uses keys in order to interact with these beats

2 default beatmaps- a minimum of two songs for everyone to play in class, hopefully more

Want to have:
Beatmap Editor - An in-app way to create or edit beatmaps. Would take in an mp3 file,
then would ask for information of the song (BPM, offset), ask for beatmap information 
(approach rate, beat size, HP drain, colors, background image), then give a graphical
editor that allows the user to select a minigame mode, click-and-drop beats in the appropriate fashion

In-game settings(volume levels, keybindings, etc.)  - extra menu for players to tweak game settings to their liking
Better Animations - smoother gameplay
Listen Mode - enjoy your fabulous music without the game playing stress
Skins - recolour gameplay and change sound effects to your liking

Stretch Goals:
Tutorial Mode - special beatmap to explain controls
Additional minigames - more games, more fun
Networked leaderboard - server needed
Multiplayer (versus mode) - local/online
Mods - a set of difficulty increasers or decreasers for every Beatmap. This would
include things like “No Fail,” “Easy,” “Hidden,” “Double Time,” “Flashlight,” and “Auto”

Class List:
MainMenuScreen - the main menu
SongSelectScreen - the screen that you select your song on
GameScreen - the actual screen for playing the game
Score - keeps score as the player plays, displays it
Song - music of the Beatmap
SoundEffects - the beeps and dings
Beatmap - contains the combination of beats that make up each game
Combo - a string of Beats together that assigns them numbers, and 
Beat - the essential component of the game
	Slider - beats you must drag your mouse along
	Circle - the most basic beat, which the player just presses X or Z on at the right time
	Approach circle - slowly fades in around a beat to show the player when to click
	Masher - a beat where the player just mashes the X and Z keys as much as possible
	Falling Beat(Catch the beat) - the special beats moving down the screen for catching
Catcher (for catch the beat) - the character moving at the bottom of the screen to catch beats
