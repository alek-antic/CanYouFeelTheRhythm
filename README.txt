Can You Feel the Rhythm?

By: Aleksandar Antic & Ben Bauer   // These names not subject to change

Description:
Enjoy your favorite music in a new way! Can You Feel The Rhythm??? combines music with fast paced gameplay
that is sure to increase your appreciation for song that you hear everyday! Can You Feel The Rhythm???
combines music and timing to optimize the player’s experience. Chase the Beat contains beats and sliders appearing 
around the screen, and the player must move the mouse and clock them as they appear for points. Anyone who regularly plays 
rhythm games should feel right at home, pounding away at their keyboard. Even those just starting out in the
rhythm genre can set the difficulty low and rock out to their favorite songs.

Instructions:

Chase the Beat: Move the mouse and press either Z or X to score the notes

Feature List:

Must Have:
x Menus - navigation through the game, in order to make use easier

x Chase the Beat - game mode #1 - beats scattered across screen at proper timing, react properly to mouseover and key presses

TO BE DONE THIS WEEKEND (Test beats in place) 2 default beatmaps- a minimum of two songs for everyone to play in class, hopefully more

Want to have:
Beatmap Editor - An in-app way to create or edit beatmaps. Would take in an mp3 file,
then would ask for information of the song (BPM, offset), ask for beatmap information 
(approach rate, beat size, HP drain, colors, background image), then give a graphical
editor that allows the user to select a minigame mode, click-and-drop beats in the appropriate fashion

In-game settings(volume levels, keybindings, etc.)  - extra menu for players to tweak game settings to their liking
Better Animations - smoother gameplay
Listen Mode - enjoy your fabulous music without the game playing stress
Skins - recolour gameplay and change sound effects to your liking

Stretch Goals:
Tutorial Mode - special beatmap to explain controls
Additional minigames - more games, more fun
Networked leaderboard - server needed
Multiplayer (versus mode) - local/online
Mods - a set of difficulty increasers or decreasers for every Beatmap. This would
include things like “No Fail,” “Easy,” “Hidden,” “Double Time,” “Flashlight,” and “Auto”

Class List:
CanYouFeelTheRhythm - the main class
RhythmFrame - the JFrame to hold everything
FailureScreen - the screen the pops up when a beatmap is failed
SummaryScreen - the screen that comes up after a beatmap is successfully completed
Receiver - An interface to help control GameScreen
MainMenuScreen - the main menu
SongSelectScreen - the screen that you select your song on
GameScreen - the actual screen for playing the game
Score - keeps score as the player plays, displays it
Beatmap - contains the combination of beats that make up each game
Combo - a string of Beats together that assigns them numbers, and 
ApproachCircle- the circle that closes in around a beat in Chase The Beat to denote the timing
Beat - the essential component of the game
	Slider - beats you must drag your mouse along
	Circle - the most basic beat, which the player just presses X or Z on at the right time
	Masher - a beat where the player just mashes the X and Z keys as much as possible


Responsibility List:

Aleksandar: all Beats and all Beatmap related classes
Ben:  all Screens, and drawing code
